/* EE 468:  Test for device driver project 
 *
 * You will likely have to change the open() since your
 * device name may be different.
 *
 * The test will write and read character strings into
 * the device.  Then it displays, using printf, the
 * results of the reads.  Record these outputs from
 * the printfs into a file.
